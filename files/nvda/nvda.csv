"deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, interconnect, and software"
"layers. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets,"
"which include Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we"
"address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs, CUDA and networking technologies as the fundamental building blocks. The"
programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in research and development: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end
markets with shared underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. We utilize
this platform approach in each of our target markets.
"Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing platform for AI, addressing both training"
"and inferencing. This includes full-stack data center-scale compute and networking solutions across processing units, interconnects, systems, and software. Our"
"compute solutions include all three major processing units in AI servers – GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add"
"AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position. In addition, we offer DGX Cloud, an AI-training-as-a-service platform, and"
"NeMo – a complete solution for building enterprise-ready Large Language Models, or LLMs, using open source and proprietary LLMs created by NVIDIA and"
third parties. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our computing platforms are available from
"virtually every major server maker and CSP, as well as on our own AI supercomputers. There are over 4.7 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our"
other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and thousands of
"startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy"
"• A significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to end customers,"
and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these end customers.
"• We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees."
"• Modification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls."
"• Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities"
"analysts or investors, our stock price could decline."

operational harm and liability.
"• Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability."
"• Adequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from"
making or selling our products.
"• We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations. These areas could damage our"
"reputation, deter customers, affect product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability."
"• Our operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates, changes in tax laws, and other tax-related"
factors.

•,"increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our"
"loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully"
"detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures."
"Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent"
"and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is"
delayed or not feasible.
"Individuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged"
"and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally, some actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated"
"attacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened"
"have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others"
"may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to"
"our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our"
business.
"Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the events"
"described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As"
"we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages"
"and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or"
"regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and"
services.
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
"Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and"
"reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme"
"heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for"
"our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact"
"on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our"
"vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we"
"maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and"
•,"our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain"
and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and
"services, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its"
"adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions"
"that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or"
"other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and"
"use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying"
"with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain"
"jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with"
"existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in"
"response to the Biden administration’s Executive Order on AI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting"
"and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify the USG of certain safety"
"test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change"
"damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could"
"result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal"
claims.
"In the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal"
"data privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on"
"covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As"
"applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as"
"targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and"
"services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy"
"impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by"
"the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing"
"of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional"
"violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal"
"and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products"
"and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase."
Worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted
"the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of"
"persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose"
"data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or"
"4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of"
"their personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to"
change our business practices.
"In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain"
"jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of"
personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly
"transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the"
"United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K."
extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms
"that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is"
no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are
"considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of"
"doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data"
"localization. Data broadly defined as important under China’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment"
"and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of"
"such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The"
"inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties"
"that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe"

"We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,"
"or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of"
"grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs"
and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs
"is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP,"
using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is
"valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and"
comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic
factors and the future profitability of our business.
Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
"Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under"
"technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a"
"method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably"
"determined, using a straight-line amortization method."
"Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in"
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and
used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by
"the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the"
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based
on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately
"presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no"
longer be depreciated.
Business Combination
"We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on"
their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded
"as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently"
"uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of"
"projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,"
